|project| 0.7
=============

We are happy to announce the release of version 0.7 of |project|. The
development activities in this cycle focused on

* TCP socket transport introduced and default
* Error recovery, robustness and features of |project| and RSBag tools
* End-user documentation
* Packaging and deployment

In the process, about 70 issues have been created and subsequently
resolved.

This |project| release is available in the following forms:

* Source archives
* Pre-compiled self-installing archives or executable binaries
* Debian packages for different |ubuntu| versions
* Prototypical homebrew recipes and pypi packages

Installation instructions and links for downloading can be found on
the preparation page of the |project| :ref:`end-user documentation
<index>`.

As always, bugs, feature requests and enhancement proposals can be
reported in the respective issue trackers: `RSB
<https://code.cor-lab.org/projects/rsb/issues>`_, `RSBag
<https://code.cor-lab.org/projects/rsbag/issues>`_.

.. note::

   Only TCP socket transport is now enabled by default.

.. note::

   Log files recorded with the 0.7 version of RSBag cannot be
   processed with older RSBag versions. The opposite direction works,
   though.

For transport configuration issues see :ref:`troubleshooting`.

For a more detailed list of fixed bugs, added features and other
enhancements, see https://code.cor-lab.org/versions/22.

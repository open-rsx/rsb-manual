====================
Installing |project|
====================

Currently, the |version| version of |project| can either be installed
manually by compiling the source code or in binary forms using pre-generated
packages. Depending on your needs you should chose one of these possibilities.

Pre-generated packages
   For pre-generated packages a package maintainer has already preformed
   the work of compiling the software or providing the required instructions.
   Hence, the installation of |project| is a very simple operation.
   However, with this installation method you cannot modify |project|
   itself. This does not limit your ability to develop applications that
   use |project|! In case you just want to use |project|, chose this
   installation method.

Compilation from source
   All software needs to be compiled manually using the build systems.
   You should choose this solution in case you want to develop on |project|
   itself, as the source code will remain under your complete control and
   you are in a good position to change it frequently.

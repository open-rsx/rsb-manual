.. java:method::  boolean match(Event event)
   :outertype: Filter

   Tells whether the given event matches the filter and hence shall be dispatched or not.

   :param event: the event to test, not \ ``null``\
   :return: \ ``true``\  if the event matches the restrictions specified by this filter and hence can be delivered to the client, \ ``false``\  to remove the event from the stream.

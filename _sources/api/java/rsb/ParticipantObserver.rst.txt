ParticipantObserver
===================

.. java:package:: rsb
   :noindex:

.. java:type:: public interface ParticipantObserver

   Interface for observing \ :java:ref:`Participant`\  creation and destruction. Since methods of this interface are called during state switching of \ :java:ref:`Participant`\  instances, the \ :java:ref:`Participant.isActive()`\  method might still return an old state during calls to methods in this interface.

 Configuration
===============

The configuration mechanism in |project| is based on the following
principles:

* The configuration mechanism works identically across implementation
  languages

* We cannot (and do not want to) handle configuration of individual
  :term:`participants <participant>`:

  * The configuration mechanism is intended to provide process-wide
    defaults.

  * :term:`Participants <participant>` that require individual configurations have
    to be configured programmatically.

* Configuration options are obtained from multiple configuration
  sources:

  * `Configuration files`_
  * `Environment variables`_

..  * `Commandline options`_

* Configuration options are organized in a tree of `name-value pairs`_

Configuration Debugging
=======================

In complex systems, it is sometimes not clear how the configuration in
effect in a particular part of the system came
about. |project|\ -based systems are no exception. To assist users in
such situations, |project| provides a few configuration debugging
tools.

The simplest and often most effective configuration debugging tool is
the :envvar:`RSB_CONFIG_DEBUG` environment variable. When set to any
value, it causes |project|\ -based programs to print informative
messages during configuration processing:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ RSB_CONFIG_DEBUG=1 RSB_TRANSPORT_SPREAD_ENABLED=1 rsb-infocpp0.15

Option names consist of multiple components which are specified in
configuration-source-dependent syntax. For example, in `configuration
files`_ section names like ``[transport.spread]`` are concatenated
with names of contained options like ``port`` to obtain
``transport.spread.port``. For `environment variables`_, the name
:envvar:`RSB_TRANSPORT_SPREAD_PORT` is mapped to
``transport.spread.port``.

Currently the following option tree is defined (uppercase option name
components are placeholders, :samp:`{LANGUAGE}` refers to the
implementation language, e.g. ``cpp``, ``java``, etc.)

Effective Configuration
=======================

Configuration sources are processed in the following order such that
options from sources which are processed later take precedence over
options from sources which are processed earlier:

#. Start with **Global Defaults**

#. Merge with **Config Files** ("Merge 3"), being the result of:

   #. Start with **System Config** file |system_config_file|

   #. Merge with **User Config** file |user_config_file| ("Merge 1")

   #. Merge with **Current Directory Config** file |pwd_config_file|
      ("Merge 2")

#. Merge with :ref:`options supplied via environment variables
   <specification-config-environment-variables>` ("Merge 4")

#. Merge with :ref:`programatically supplied options
   <specification-config-programmatic-options>` ("Merge 6")

..
   #. Merge with :ref:`commandline options
      <specification-config-commandline-options>` ("Merge 5")

   #. Merge with :ref:`options supplied via URI
      <specification-config-uri-options>` ("Merge 7")

.. note::

.. _specification-config-file-cascade:

Non-default Configuration File Cascade
--------------------------------------

The environment variable :envvar:`RSB_CONFIG_FILES` can be used to
make |project| load a different cascade of configuration files than
the one described above.

Acceptable values are lists of filenames separated by ``:``. In
addition to filenames, the following placeholders can be used:

``%system``

  Is replaced with the name of the **System Config** file
  |system_config_file| described above.

``%user``

  Is replaced with the **User Config** file |user_config_file|
  described above.

``%pwd``

  Is replaced with the **Current Directory Config** file
  |pwd_config_file| described above.

Example:

.. parsed-literal::

      %system:/my-etc/rsb.conf:%user:/my-other-etc//rsb.conf
   => |system_config_file|:/myetc/rsb.conf:|user_config_file|:/my-other-etc//rsb.conf

Sources
=======

The following sections briefly explain the currently defined
configuration sources.

.. _specification-config-files:

Configuration Files
-------------------

Configuration files use the following syntax, which is similar to
`INI-files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_ or `desktop-files
<http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/>`_

* Comments are initiated by the ``#`` character and extend to the end
  of the current line

* After removing comments, all lines have to be of one of the
  following forms:

  * empty

  * :samp:`[{NAME}]` where :samp:`NAME` consists of alphanumeric
    characters and colons

  * :samp:`{NAME} = {VALUE}` where :samp:`NAME` consists of
    alphanumeric characters

  * Double quotes (``"``) can be used in :samp:`{NAME}` to avoid
    splitting at ``.`` characters. E.g ``[transport."socket.new"]``
    would interpreted as the section name ``(transport, socket.new)``.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: ini

   [qualityofservice]
   reliability = UNRELIABLE
   ordering = UNORDERED

   [errorhandling]
   onhandlererror = LOG

   [transport.spread]
   host    = localhost
   port    = 4803
   enabled = 1                          # this is the default

   [spread.converter.cpp]
   image = IplImage                     # wire-schema = data-type

   [transport.inprocess]
   foo     = barbar
   factor  = 1.5
   enabled = 1

   [plugins.cpp]
   path = /vol/vampire/lib:/vol/cor/lib
   load = rsbspread:rsbvampire     # no filetype suffix

Please note that only files with the platform's respective line
endings are supported (i.e. ``\n`` on Linux and ``\r\n`` on Windows).

.. _specification-config-environment-variables:

Environment Variables
---------------------

Environment variables are processed according to the following rules:

#. Variables whose names start with ``RSB_`` are processed

#. The ``RSB_`` prefix is stripped form the name

#. To obtain the name of the corresponding option, the remainder of
   the name is converted to lower case and split at ``_`` characters

Examples:

* :envvar:`RSB_PLUGINS_CPP_LOAD`      -> ``plugins.cpp.load``

* :envvar:`RSB_TRANSPORT_SPREAD_PORT` -> ``transport.spread.port``

..
  .. _specification-config-commandline-options:

  Commandline Options (TODO this was a section but sections cannot appear in comments)

  Commandline options are processed according to the following rules:

  #. Options whose names start with ``rsb-`` are processed

  #. Language-specific name components (such as ``plugins.cpp.load``)
     are dropped. For example, the option named ``plugin.cpp.load``
     corresponds to the ``--rsb-plugins-load`` commandline option

  #. Components are joined with/strings are split at ``-`` characters

  Examples:

  * :option:`--rsb-plugins-load`          -> ``plugins.cpp.load``

  * :option:`--rsb-transport-spread-port` -> ``transport.spread.port``

.. _specification-config-programmatic-options:

Programmatic Options
--------------------

Please have a look at the API documentation for ParticipantConfig (C++, Python)
or Properties (Java). Links to the API documentation can be found in the left
sidebar.

..
  .. _specification-config-uri-options:

  URI Options

Example and Test Case
=====================

Consider the following situation:

* Contents of |user_config_file|

  .. code-block:: ini

     [transport.spread]
     host = azurit
     port = 5301

* Contents of |pwd_config_file|

  .. code-block:: ini

     [transport.spread]
     host = localhost

* Environment Variables

  :envvar:`RSB_TRANSPORT_SPREAD_PORT` = ``4444``

This should result in the following effective option values:

* ``transport.spread.host = localhost``

* ``transport.spread.port = 4444``
